# Turn_On_Off_USB_Relay

Control your relay USB device from an Android app.

In order to control the "8 Channel 12V Low Level USB Relay Module," you need a computer or smartphone.
An electronic device without "brain" can't communicate with the relay, so we need "the middle device" between them.
In order to control the relay, you must have a USB connection in your target, so if you are using your Android phone, use an OTG cable.
